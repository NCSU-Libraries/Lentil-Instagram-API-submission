# Application Description

The purpose of the NCSU Libraries Lentil app is to aggregate Instagram images that showcase the wonderful spaces and services provided by NCSU Libraries. We do this by encouraging our campus community, and the public at large, to add specific hashtags to their photos that coincide with events occurring at the libraries. This allows us to centrally collect and add these photos to our University archives.
